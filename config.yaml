    subtitle: "Hi my name is Mike Dizon, a native of the Republic of the Philippines. I graduated college in 2018 with a Bsc in Business Administration and worked for the Philippine National Treasury for 3 years since then. I am currently taking up a Masters in Finance at the London Business School and I will be graduating on July 2023, hoping to transition into a career in the asset management industry. You can find more details about me through my CV. Recently, I also got very interested in learning about data science through programming languages such as Python and R. In this website, you can see some of my work on data manipulation, data visualization, and machine learning. I hope you found the contents useful and I look forward to connecting someday!"
